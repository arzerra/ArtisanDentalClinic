Good question — and this is super important 👇

❌ No, you can’t directly use npx shadcn@latest add dashboard-01 on a plain React project (like a Vite or Create React App setup).

That command only works for Next.js projects that use:

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

shadcn/ui (which depends on Next.js conventions like /app or /components folders and tsx files)

🧩 Why it doesn’t work in plain React:

The shadcn CLI expects Next.js routing and layout structure.

It automatically creates files that use server components, TypeScript (.tsx), and Next-specific imports like next/link.

If you try it in React, you’ll get missing module errors.

✅ But here’s what you can do:

You can still use shadcn/ui components in your React project manually.

Here’s how:

Make sure you have Tailwind CSS installed and configured.

Visit the official shadcn/ui site
.

Copy component code manually from there (each has a “Copy code” button).

Paste it into your React project’s components/ folder.

Replace imports like next/link with React equivalents (e.g. react-router-dom’s Link).

If you want, I can show you how to set up shadcn/ui manually in a React project (with one working dashboard component).
